# Matching-colorschemes-of-images
Jupyter Notebook that matches the color scheme of an input image the color scheme of an target image by creating a color lookup table (LUT) for the input image. This LUT can be applied for example in Photoshop. The scope of this project is mainly to show how such an algorithm can look like and how LUTs work. However it is also a powerful tool for example the matching of gold tones.
